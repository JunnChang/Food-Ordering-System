Our program wuld start by prompting user to select whether to add item into menu or proceed to order.

If user select not to add item into menu, they would need to restart the program to add as we think that any 
restaurant would add new menu at the beginning of the day.

Please follow the instructions that is prompted, It can be 1,2,3 or 'Y', 'N'.

There is options for you to End the program, But it might no generate report if it's not used 
according to the instruction prompted to user.


Main thing about our code is we're using CSV to handle and append food inside.
We also generate a small report on the quantity sold for that day and the revenue.
The group did a great job in making this assignment happen.
food.txt and drinks.txt are storing CSV.

Thank you for reading this, have a good day!
